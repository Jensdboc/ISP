In order to run our application, a .zip file is given, called BotanicBrain.zip. Inside the .zip we find a
folder called BotanicBrAIn, inside of which there are several files: model.h5, BotanicBrainDemo.ipynb,
utils.py and some pictures. BotanicBrain.zip has to be uploaded to Google Drive’s root folder
and, then, unzipped. If everything is done correctly, both model.h5 and BotanicBrainDemo.ipynb
should appear in:

content/drive/MyDrive/BotanicBrAIn/

After doing so, the file BotanicBrainDemo.ipynb has to be executed entirely. In the second-last
cell, there is the option to select the city in which the plant is supposedly located. In the last cell, an
interface showing a real-time video and some information about each video’s frame appears. Note
that the city has to be changed only when the video is not running.
In order to stop the application, the user can simply click on the video. After a few moments, the
application will stop.

Important remark: it is advised to run the application using GPU.
